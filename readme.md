# ⚽ **Dominion FC**  
🔮 *Optimize Your Football Squad with Machine Learning & genAI*  



---

## 🚀 **About the Project**  
**Dominion FC** is a web-based tool designed to help football managers and enthusiasts create the **best possible squad** using advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization Techniques**. The app rates players, predicts their auction cost, and forms the optimal starting XI based on a budget constraint — just like a professional football draft!

## 🌟 **Features**  
✅ **Player Position** – Predicts player position to maximize its performance .  
✅ **Cost Prediction** – Predicts player auction costs using ML models.  
✅ **Linear Programming (Knapsack)** – Applies the **Knapsack algorithm** to form the best squad within a set budget.  
✅ **Position-Specific Buckets** – Organizes players into categories:  
   - 🥅 Goalkeepers  
   - 🛡️ Defenders  
   - 🎯 Midfielders  
   - ⚡ Forwards  

✅ **Comparison and Filters** – Compare players and apply filters for quick decision-making.  
✅ **Interactive Graphs** – View player stats and performance trends through intuitive visualizations.  
✅ **Firebase Authentication** – Secure login using Firebase.  
✅ **Neon Db Integration** – Backend powered by neon for fast and reliable data storage and CRUD operations.
